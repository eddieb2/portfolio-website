Notes for Responsive Design II Project

// HTML
          Things that are confusing
1. It looks like there is a lot of HTML that isn't being displayed. Why is it there and what is it? 
  - Line 101 and 340
  - Line 101 to 119 (Article?)
  - Line 130 to 162 (List?)
  - Line 164 to 173 (Actions?)
  - Etc.

I deleted lines 128-340 and it didn't seem to brick the website. Could this be because those are hidden elements or just not used in any way?

2. What are scripts?
  - Client-side JS
  - Points to external script file through SRC attribute.

3. What is the div on   line 352 used for ? It's an empty div with an id of "bg".

// CSS
1. What is a z-index?
    -looked it up
